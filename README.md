# Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation applied to poetry in English and Catalan
This project aims to test Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation by using a specific genre: poetry. In this project, two books of poems of two different languages are compared: English and Catalan. The objective of doing this comparison is to not only test if the Law of Abbreviation works with the poetry genre, but also to test if there are differences between languages.
